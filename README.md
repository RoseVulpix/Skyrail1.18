# Skyrail CTM 1.18.2
Skyrail is a quest-driven CTM(complete the monument) modpack for Minecraft 1.18.2 that starts you from one island and expands through there. There will be progression and exploration, so prepare, get some rails, and then get ready to explore! What islands are you encountering today?

Skyrail tackles the odd gap in modded CTM packs for 1.18, but also remixes some light technological progression along with it. Also, the best way you will be going around are rails.
